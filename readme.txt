Plugin that provides users option to display carousel widget for sidebar and carousel for page

== Description ==

This plugin lets you to display carousel widget on sidebar with the themes that supports sidebar (it does not work properly on footer). Right now it is on auto play only mode, with fixed height and width and movement interval.

It also lets users to add the bigger carousel on the page. However it is not set on auto play. The image moves on once user click the other images and image also has the link which redirects user to site where developer wishes.

I wish to add options to customize the widget and frontend display of the carousel on later versions.

Note: This plugin is based on Roundabout jQuery plugin

3. A new "Carousel Widget" will be available under Appearance > Widgets, where you can add it to your sidebar
4. At the Setting section on dashboard ‘Carousel Widget’ will appear where developer can add images and information they wish to display on carousel.  
5.To add carousel on page use shortcode [inpage_carousel].
